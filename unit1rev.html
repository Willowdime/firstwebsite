    <h2>2.1 Reviewing use of IT tools when making this website</h2> <a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>The use of Visual Studio Code with its very intuitive user interface and plethora of add-ons available to improve workflow, has been the entire foundation of this project. I am confident that if I were to choose only one too for this project, it would be VSCode.
        <br>
        <br>
        W3Schools is not only a place to read and learn about what a particular piece of code does, you can run the code from within their website to see exactly what it does. It has been my library, my knowledge fountain, the rock to which I have been anchored.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trello, although very simple, has massively helped me lay out everything I needed to do for the week, and hit my deadlines.
        <br>
        <br>
        Writing huge blocks of text quickly and efficiently is paramount to the success of this project. So, I used Microsoft Word for it’s excellent built in grammar and punctuation checking. Allowing me to type really fast, and not weigh myself down carefully typing each letter.

    <h2>2.2 Were these chosen IT tools appropriate</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>The aforementioned IT tools in 2.1 were all very suitable, and I detailed why in that section. However, a tool that I did not find a use for – despite my trying – was draw.io.

        In theory writing up a box with an arrow linking it to the next would symbolise webpages and their affiliated URL links. But in practice trying to account for every web-page, and their respective arrows turned into what I will refer to as “Spaghetti Cake”. I’ll leave the rest up to your imagination.

<div id="2.3" class="text">
    <h2>2.3 Strengths and weaknesses of the finial project.</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>Considering that this is my first attempt at a website, I would say that I am pleased with the over-all result. It turned out as I expected it to. I had a very dark and minimalist vision for this one, and featuring my 3D artwork really helped make it pop out at you! I find the overall flow and feel of the website simple but coherent. The effect I was looking for was a reading-oriented design, that doesn’t distract the user from getting straight into the juicy bits. <br>
    <br>
    Things I would like to change however, include minor visual bugs that I have failed to find a work around for. For example, I would like to prevent the webpage from having a side-scroll function and remove the top and left margins around my images on the about page.

<div id="2.4" class="text">
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p><p>Things I would like to add in the future, on my free time are purely aesthetic. Custom box borders for the text windows, to better suit the rest of the site. Drop down menus instead of loads of buttons everywhere. And a section showing off a live version of my planetary motion animation. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I think if followed another week’s worth of advanced CSS and HTML, built up a decent mood board, set up an incremental improvement checklist, I could possibly have a junior-professional grade website.

    <h2>2.5 Outcome reviews</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>Unit 1 Outcome 1: All of what was written is from memory. I fear however that throughout this entire exercise – across all units – I struggle to capture the feel of IT Consultant. I’m also lying in hope that I have not misunderstood GDPR. I am certain that I have understood it to the very best of my ability however.

    Unit 1 Outcome 2:
    Unit 1 Outcome 3: This one presented a challenge. Having to interpret or decern the situation in which these solution need to be applied or even conceived, has made each section quite long, but as detailed and – to my knowledge – accurate as possible.
    Unit 2 Outcome 1:
