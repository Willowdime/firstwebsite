    <p>Before answering these questions, we must first outline a clear definition of what IT is. IT stands for information technology, and it’s just that. Any form of technology that deals in the handling of information. These methods of handling can be, but are not limited to, storing, retrieving, sending, interpreting various classs of digital and in some cases physical information. Knowing the fundamental ways of handling information with technology and then applying this to a basic understanding of the structure of a business, will help us in answering these questions.</p>

    <h2>1.1 Purpose of IT in modern Business</h2> <a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>Honestly. I wish I could just say it varies, but we all know that won’t suffice. IT is used every day extensively. We have computers that we write documents on or calculate finances into spreadsheets with graphs. We use them to present ideas to rooms full of colleagues using projectors, and change slides with wireless controllers. And with the use of the internet, instant international communication with anyone else with a connection to the internet is possible. Mobile phones condense all of this into a tiny pocket-sized format.
        Let us use a fictional scenario to highlight some of the many important ways a business can make use of information technology. You wish to start a business, and don’t know where to start. The first step you would then need is to gather knowledge, which is built up of bits information (hehe). A good starting place is the internet. So now you’ve got an understanding of how to start your business, you load up a text editor to start writing up a business plan, then you may use spreadsheets to manage and calculate finances for your business. There is a near uncountable number of tools available for businesses on the internet. Your bank account is managed by storing your information on tiny drives, stacked into huge servers, in giant refrigerated server rooms. Then they’ll have a server that deals with retrieving your information (maybe logging into online banking) so you may look over it, then store some new information (in the form of a deposit). 
    <br>
    <br>
        For something like a 3D graphics studio however, there may be studios set up with many small computers wired special light catching diodes encased in mirrored or lenses light funnels, all to track particular wavelengths of light (colour), interpret the activation or deactivation of these individual light sensitive diodes. They are cameras. Glossing over a few more steps, we finally transfer the frame by frame capture of this information to a PC with a special software designed to translate said information into a 3D representation. Let’s say that you now want to duplicate said 3D model into a real physical object… Que 3D printing.

    <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>A cup full of organisation skills, a couple notepads of knowledge and info, a tool box, and tape it all together with plenty of resilient patience. There…. Need elaboration? Well seeing any project through requires time and patience, being ready for set-backs, and communicating well with your team. You’ll need to build working relationships with people who can help you build up your customer base. The resources you’ll need may vary, but the basics these days are a mobile phone, a laptop or PC, an internet connection and the beginnings of an online presence. You may consider subscriptions for using relevant industry specific software. You will need both physical storage drives and online storage for backups. Consider protecting your data with VPNs and a strong anti-virus.</p>

    <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>As of writing this I am creating a Trello board. Giving it minor details and accurate bullet points. All of the text in this webpage has been written out in Microsoft Word. I have use a variety of online resources such as Wikipedia, W3Schools, Stack Overflow, CSS-tricks, and a few others. <br>
        <br>
        The code for each page and its visual formatting was written in Visual Studio Code. 
        The design and layout were conceptualised in GIMP, a free photo-manipulation software similar to photoshop.

    <h2>1.4 What risks may impact the success of a digital project</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>The main risks are a failure to communicate; misjudging the weight of tasks and whom they are assigned to; not estimating the correct amount of time each task will take/over shooting your deadline; losing progress due to sloppy file saving and backups; lazy bug squashing; and last but not least : bad research, poor planning, and above all, a lack of resilience.</p>

    <h2>1.5 How would you go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>We first need to know what we have to work with, what we want to achieve with it, and what we absolutely must do with it. Other things such as budget and platform must be taken into consideration as well. Amongst other things I would also consider the size of the team and the client base you wish to target. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, if you are a making feature films, you’ll likely be using an Adobe Studio licence which can be thousands a per month! However, modelling and animating a basic character for an indie game is very achievable in Blender and can yield excellent results! Did I mention Blender is free? Here’s a glimpse of a blender scene I’m working on below.

    <h2>1.6 How have your chosen technologies helped you achieve your outcomes?</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>Trello as been a wonderful and fluid method of keeping track of the tasks I’ve undertaken. Not only has it been an excellent way of sharing and storing info about my project, it’s also been a great way for me to quickly dump links and notes somewhere for me to access anywhere anytime. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have used sites such as GitHub, W3Schools, Stack Overflow have been an excellent source for bug fixes, sample code, programs and even entire web page templates.
        Another software I have chosen is Firefox. Small details about the way it’s optimised, and its superior security features have made me feel more secure whilst researching. It has very powerful bookmarking tools, and plenty of room for expansion with extensions.

    <h2>1.7 Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>First let’s look into a quick overview of the 7 Principles of General Data Protection.
        <br>
        <br>

        I : Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency: Do not use data that you are not legally authorised to use, if you are allowed to use it in the way you said you would, and you must keep the data holder aware of the purpose, the means and the time. Let the data holder know exactly your intentions.
        <br>
        <br>
        II : Purpose Limitation: transparency reworded basically. You can only collect and use data for the “specified, explicit and legitimate” purpose you provided.
        <br>
        <br>
        III: Data Minimisation: Collect the minimum you need. Under the GDPR you must design an adequate policy and document why you are using the data.
        <br>
        <br>
        IV: Accuracy: any personal data must accurate and where necessary kept up to date. You may not retain old and outdated information.
        <br>
        <br>
        V: Storage Limitations: You need to outline the retention period for the data. You cannot hold on to it for longer than your necessary specified objectives, and it must be documented.
        <br>
        <br>
        VI : Integrity and Confidentiality : Keep it secure. You need to handle the data in such a way that protects against unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage. And you must implement efficient anonymisation or pseudonymisation systems to protect the identity of you clients.
        <br>
        <br>
        VII : Accountability : Record and prove compliance. Make sure you and the data holder follow through on the policies you both agreed upon. New Legislation requires a thorough documentation of all your policies that deal in data.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition websites are protected by copyright laws. This gives the owner of a specific art piece the right to copy and legally redistribute that art piece as they please. This means that no one else can use or sell your art piece without your documented and expressed permission. This both protects you from people copying your websites content and prevents you from doing so to others, without said permissions. Copyright is not a legal right and must be applied form, in some cases even faught over. All of the above applies to any content you create including websites.
        <br>
        <br>
        Conclusion. A digital project will be delayed by extensive legal documentation, and further delayed by the adjustment or correction of these documents. You’ll have a huge responsibility to manage peoples info correctly, and will maybe even have financial implications in the form of employment of admin crew. The same can be said about copyrighting. The due process for verifying that you are the genuine creator of the content you wish to copyright costs time and money.
