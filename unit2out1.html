    <h2>1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page</h2> <a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>Each of the Unit pages contain questions and demonstrative exercises highlighted in black round-edged boxes nested in lighter grey boxes containing the responses to these questions and exercises. For additional navigation fluidity, I added in smooth scrolling "back to top" buttons. In the spirit of keeping it easily readable and translatable to mobile platforms, everything is centred on each page with automatic margin and text formatting.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Home, About, and Contact page are laid out in a similar fashion, just using a different header style.

    <h2>1.3 Selecting and using website features</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>To avoid over complicating my website, the fancy features I knew I really wanted were colour fading buttons on hover; a nice header image that stretches across the page, and jump-to somewhere on page with smooth-scrolling. Haven’t tried it? Give it a go!

    Important things to note about building a website. Any images or files you wish to use need to be placed within the root folder of the websites home-page .html which MUST be called index.html. Most image formats can be used in the creation of a website, in this project I used .png and .jpg files.

    <h2>1.4 Selecting and using styles</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
    <p>As you may have noticed earlier, the style I went for is the default Blender interface colour theme and border style. I even managed to find the same font. I achieved this by using W3Schools and digging through the Blender file directory to figure out exactly what kind of fonts and proportions to use.

        In summary, website copyright gives the owner of that art the right to copy. No one else may copy it. This both protects you from people copying your websites content and prevents you from doing so to others, without permission. You must apply for copyright ownership over a website or any art for that matter. If you end up using cookies on a website you must adhere to GDPR in the case of using people’s data, like their location, name, or even bank details.</p>
