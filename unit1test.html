        <p>On this one. I would like to directly compare the software I used to highlight their specific benefits and drawbacks.

            <br>
            Although I stated in Unit 1 Outcome 2.1, that I could do this entire project in VSCode, it would have taken twice as long. Organising this project would have been much more challenging and nowhere near as readable and condensable as Trello. Though there are spellcheckers for VSCode, they pale in comparison to the near human English teacher levels of accuracy that you get from Microsoft Word. Likewise, Trello may offer some spell-checking services, but adding large blocks of text conflict with the readability of its intended purpose on such a short project. VSCode offers features similar to Word, but centred around coding. While I could write out a huge block of code in Word, I there would be no syntax-finishing, error messages, debugging, syntax highlighting or even the right kind of predictive text.

        <h2>3.2 Productivity improvements</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
        <p>The selection and application of the tools in this project were done optimally. However, if there were team members taking on the roles of team lead and organiser, researcher, writer, designer, and programmer respectively, this project could have been executed much more swiftly.

        <p>As mentioned before, I am very confident that I selected and used the best tools possible in a competent manner consistently throughout this project.<br>
        <br>
        Due to some personal reasons this week, however. I was rather socially withdrawn, and did not interact much - near at all - with the rest of the cohort. While I have received extensive team participation and management training in the past, on this project I found it easier to work alone. It may be a symptom of grieving, however that is the way it is for now. Give me a task, leave me to it. I am working on my interpersonal skills consistently as they are still there, just a littled dulled. The best solution I have is to talk with people, keep them posted about how I’m doing, hear how they are, spend time with family and keep myself busy.

        <h2>3.4 Testing digital solutions</h2><a href="#top"> <button class="buttonj"> Back to Top</button> </a>
        <p>I’ll need to employ some creative licencing on this one. I would assume by digital solution you refer to a scenario like this one: “I have the need to achieve a goal. But there are too many options. I must test the digital solutions available for my purpose.”
            If this is the case, I would generally start by comparing a feature list of the products. Weighing up whether they fit my purpose and budget. Once I have a narrowed down list of products I wish to test, I would then put them through their paces with stress tests, bug report forums, my own personal tests, as well as document my findings while using them. I would then compare my reviews side by side and once again weigh in the budget, time constraints, learning curve/usability, and finally the overall product finish and quality, to ensure that what I choose is entirely fit for purpose.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            If however, we are discussing a digital solution such as an error message while programming, or looking to implement a certain feature to my program, then my first step will always be tech forums - and newly asking my cohort. Asking reddit communities for the best resources for the language I am working with, watching YouTube videos and using their respective comment section, or just a well worded Google search. I’ll start by putting these solutions to the test on a “test” file. Something I can break, corrupt or damage without impacting the main file. Once I get a working solution from troubleshooting in the test file, I’ll implement it into the main file.
